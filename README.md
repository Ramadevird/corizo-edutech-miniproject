Title: Fake News Prediction Project

Description:
During my Corizo internship, I successfully completed a project on fake news prediction. Using logistic regression, I developed a classification model to distinguish between fake and genuine news articles. To convert the textual data into numerical representation, I utilized the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer. This allowed me to capture the importance of words in each article relative to the entire corpus. The project encompassed data collection, preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, logistic regression model training, evaluation, and visualization. By leveraging TF-IDF and logistic regression, this project demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing advanced techniques for fake news detection and classification.
